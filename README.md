# ACF Modules Assignment

### By Daniel

###### This repo was created by Daniel to practice the different ACF modules.

**Project Setup:**

- Download the repo to `/var/www/html' folder.

- Create a MySQL database named `acf_module_assignment`.

- Create a Database user to access the `acf_module_assignment` database.

- Rename the `wp-config-sample.php` to `wp-config.php` and fill in the database details.

- Run the WordPress installation.

- Activate the `Twentysixteen Child` theme from the WordPress admin dashboard.

- Create a page and find the page ID. This ID must replace the existing value in the `/wp-content/themes/twentysixteen-child/page-{ID}.php`. This will allow you to use the ACF modules in the page with the corresponding ID.
